<h1>Python Shape Drawing Project</h1>
<pre>
In this project, we were challenged to create a program in Python that takes user input
to draw a shape with the user's choice of color and the number of sides. I was partnered
with Abigail to create this project.

While coding using Python, I noticed some similarities to Scratch. However, I have determined
that Python is much more superior to Scrath due to many reasons. Scratch and Python both have
control's for the movement of sprites as well as variables.

Scratch does not have the power to handle large amounts of code and there are issues with the
site and code itself that causes user code to sometimes non-function. It is also a G.U.I.
(Graphic User Interface) that allows for easy drag and drop coding.

Python is a programming language, with plenty of power and generally no issues stemming
